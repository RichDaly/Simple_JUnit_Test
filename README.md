# Simple_JUnit_Test
College Assignment to create a JUnit test by refactoring a supplied Java class. Submitted December 2022 as part of the Agile Software Development Module.

## Project Requirements

You are required to develop a JUnit automated test suite that is capable of testing the supplied Java application [InsuranceProgram.java](https://github.com/RichDaly/Simple_JUnit_Test/blob/main/InsuranceProgram.java).
- You are required to refactor this code so that can be tested using JUnit5. The code can
be easily refactored by adding methods for above and below age group. Alternatively, the
code could be complete refactored using classes.
- You test should contain a test suite.
- Your test code should contain the following annotations @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @Test,
@ParameterizedTest, @Timeout, @AfterAll and @AfterEach.
- Your code should also be able to test for two different kinds of exceptions.
This program calculates car insurance premium based on age. The test suite should test every
method of your refactored source code.

**NB:** Students should consider refactoring the provided program in order to write meaningful
test cases. Students are not required to test Javas Scanner utility for I/O.

### Received Result: First Class Honours

## Running Tests

**NOTE:** The project has been uploaded as submitted. All comments in code comments are a reflection of this to explain actions. The original code before being refactored is supplied here 

This project was developed to used within the Eclipse IDE which has JUnit inbuilt. In order to see the test results a similar environment would need to be used and well as the following steps: [InsuranceProgram.java](https://github.com/RichDaly/Simple_JUnit_Test/blob/main/InsuranceProgram.java).
1. Download the `src` directory.
2. Open as a Java project in Eclipse (or similar)
3. Run as a JUnit test.
